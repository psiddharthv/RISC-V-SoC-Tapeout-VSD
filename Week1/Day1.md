#Iverilog Workflow
Major components are the design and testbench. Stimulus inputs are applied to design and outputs are monitored to check validity. Only if there is a change in the input,
there is a change in the output. These are stored at the end in a Value Change Dump (vcd) file. We can view these changes using the gtkwave tool where it will be displayed
in the form of waveforms.
